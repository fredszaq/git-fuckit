# Git Fuckit !
`git fuckit` a git command used to commit the current working directory using a message taken from [whatthecommit.com](http://whatthecommit.com). Have some fun by committing your code with silly messages.

We also provide a `git fuckthis` command that will only commit the staged changes in case you don't want to fuck it all.

## Installation
Simply drop the `git-fuckit` and `git-fuckthis` file somewhere in your path, git will find them on its own ! 

You'll need to have curl on your path as well.

There is no dependance between `git-fuckit` and `git-fuckthis` in case you want to only use one of them.

## Thanks 
A big thanks to the folks behind [whatthecommit.com](http://whatthecommit.com), you can take a look at there source code [here](https://github.com/ngerakines/commitment)

## Disclaimer
Use at your own risk, not all colleagues may appreciate the goodness of committing something with a totally irrelevant message. Seriously, don't !
